# 🧩 Structify — Smart Code Exporter

**Structify** is a lightweight web tool that helps developers quickly bundle their project files and folder structure into a single Markdown file.

You can **select multiple files or folders**, and Structify will:
- Detect their folder hierarchy automatically  
- Combine all code snippets into one clean Markdown document  
- Include a visual folder tree at the top  
- Ignore unwanted folders like `node_modules`, `.git`, `build`, etc.  

This makes it perfect for:
- Sharing code with **ChatGPT**, **colleagues**, or **mentors**  
- Submitting projects **without uploading to GitHub**  
- Keeping clean records of small codebases for documentation
